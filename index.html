<h1>Basic Human Value</h1>
<p>== Assumptions ==<br />1. An individual does more good to the society with a basic life support (such as food and shelter) than without it.<br /> a. A person's lack of motivation makes him idle, not the fulfillment of his basic necessities.<br /> b. Not being constantly anxious about basic life support makes an individual more intelligent and more productive.<br />2. A society does better overall without absolute/relative poverty than with it. <br />3. We cannot solve this problem with existing systems. (otherwise it would have already been solved)</p>
<p>== Problems with an Universal Basic Income System ==<br />1. Difficult to adjust for minimum income levels across different regions.<br />2. Adjusting for inflation is problematic.</p>
<p>== Solution: A voting-based minimum income System == <br />1. Everyone gets the same amount of single-use, split-table, nullifiable votes everyday for sending to other human players. <br />2. The owner can send his votes to organizations, but the votes will be routed to accounts of real people. <br />3. Once the owner spends his votes, he can permanently nullify their face value. This makes cheating for votes expensive.</p>
<p>There was a Black Mirror episode about this. In that episode, votes are infinite. Votes here, like one&rsquo;s cash, is finite.</p>
<p>==Possibilities ==<br />With money, there are more to be earned from the rich, leaving the poor poorly represented. With this system, there are more votes to be easily earned from the poor, making their needs a higher priority. This should counter-balance the pareto-distribution of power created by money.</p>
<p>Many platforms have already implemented the upvote feature and many people use it. By linking these upvotes with a Blockchain, the open data generated will be of high value.</p>
<p>People can upvote pirated movies, thus generating value for movie makers.<br />Refugees can upvote governments for helping them.<br />A product receiving many upvotes indicates success for advertising company.<br />E-sport players can receive upvotes.</p>
