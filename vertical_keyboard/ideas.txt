Hi, I used to own two Kinesis Advantage2 and I really liked them.I especially like how you arranged the key caps to fit different fingers.I have an improvement idea for this excellent Keyboard.If one puts both hands on the desk with palms facing each other than with palms facing down, one's spine straightens, and one's shoulder relaxes.Would it be possible to make a keyboard which enables this ?
